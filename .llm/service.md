# Hypr Remote service

How the virtual monitor, WayVNC, and the user service fit together. Derived
from `AGENTS.md`; on a conflict the constitution wins.

```text
hypr_remote.sh          lifecycle: create output, place workspace, serve, clean up
  hyprctl output create headless HEADLESS-2
  move workspace 10 onto HEADLESS-2
  wayvnc 0.0.0.0 5900 HEADLESS-2        (backgrounded, PID tracked, waited on)
  on INT/TERM/EXIT: kill only the tracked PID (no-op unless serving
  started), move workspace 10 back to HDMI-A-1

hypr_remote.service     user unit: WantedBy=graphical.target,
                        After=hyprland.service graphical.target,
                        ExecStart=%h/.local/bin/hypr_remote.sh,
                        User=RESU placeholder

install.sh              deploy: substitute RESU/GDX from live env,
                        copy unit -> ~/.config/systemd/user/,
                        copy script -> ~/.local/bin/,
                        systemctl --user daemon-reload
```

## Current values (defaults; overridable via env, see below)

- Virtual monitor: `HEADLESS-2` (created via `hyprctl output create
  headless`; a stale same-name output is removed first).
- Scratch workspace: `10` (moved onto the headless output on start, back
  onto the real monitor on exit).
- Real monitor: `HDMI-A-1` (cleanup target; where the local session keeps
  working while the remote client uses the headless output).
- VNC endpoint: `127.0.0.1:5900` against `HEADLESS-2` (localhost-only).

## Security decision (2.2)

WayVNC serves with no authentication, so the default bind is localhost and
remote access goes over `ssh -L 5900:localhost:5900 <host>`. LAN-wide exposure
(`HYPR_REMOTE_BIND=0.0.0.0`) is supported for trusted networks only — the
traffic is unencrypted VNC either way. Revisit if wayvnc gains usable auth
or TLS-by-default.

Per-host overrides (never edit the script per machine):
`HYPR_REMOTE_MONITOR`, `HYPR_REMOTE_WORKSPACE`, `HYPR_REMOTE_REAL_MONITOR`,
`HYPR_REMOTE_BIND`, `HYPR_REMOTE_PORT` — each falls back to the default
above.

When monitor or workspace names change in the script, the service and
installer need no change unless a path or placeholder moves — but this file
must be updated in the same step (its own commit on `master`).

## Dispatch API (0.56+)

Hyprland 0.56 removed the legacy `hyprctl dispatch <name> <args>` interface.
The script drives the session through the Lua dispatcher API instead:
`hl.dsp.focus({ workspace = ... })` switches workspace,
`hl.dsp.workspace.move({ workspace = ..., monitor = ... })` moves a workspace
to a monitor, and `hl.dsp.focus({ monitor = ... })` focuses a monitor. This
is a hard floor: the script no longer works on pre-0.56 Hyprland.

## Lifecycle notes

- `wayvnc` runs as a tracked background child the script waits on; stopping
  the unit (or a TERM/INT) fires the trap, which kills only that PID and
  returns the workspace to the real monitor. The trap is a no-op if serving
  never started, and idempotent across repeated signals.
- The script focuses the headless monitor before starting `wayvnc` so the
  served output has the scratch workspace visible.
- WayVNC is a prerequisite binary, not part of this repo. Empty/missing
  output or a dead workspace at serve time means the remote client sees
  nothing — reason through the `hyprctl` ordering dry before changing it.
